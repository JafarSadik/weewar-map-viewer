# Weewar Map Viewer  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JafarSadik/weewar-map-viewer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JafarSadik/weewar-map-viewer) [![Heroku](bin/readme/heroku-badge.herokuapp.png)](https://weemaps.herokuapp.com)

<!--
Browse, search and view an archive of over 12,000 original weewar.com maps. The project is currently hosted on a free Heroku dyno and therefore takes up to one minute to â€˜wake upâ€™.
    Wakes up heroku dyno as soon as someone visits the github project page.
    File /heroku/wakeup.png doesn't exist in order to prevent github CDN from 
    caching it and make sure that all HTTP requests reach target heroku server.
